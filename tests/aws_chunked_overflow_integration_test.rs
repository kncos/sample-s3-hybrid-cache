//! Integration test: aws-chunked decoder must not panic on crafted chunk headers.
//!
//! The overflow lived in `decode_aws_chunked`, which is invoked on the
//! signed-PUT path. A full listener-plus-upstream test would require
//! spinning up both the proxy and an S3 surrogate; the meaningful
//! invariant is that the decoder's public API — exercised from a separate
//! crate (tests/) — returns `Err` instead of panicking on the crafted
//! payload, and remains usable across repeated calls with mixed
//! valid/invalid inputs. That's what a panic-taking-down-the-task would
//! violate and what we check here.
//!
//! Validates: Requirements 1.3, 1.4
